# To-Do List

A simple to-do list app created as part of The Odin Project. Uses Web Storage API to keep track of ToDos and projects via local storage. Clicking on the checkbox on the right side of any ToDo will delete it if it is not unchecked in the subsequent 3 seconds (like Apple Reminders). Clicking on the colored portion on the left side of any ToDo will allow the user to change the priority of the ToDo. Clicking on the description button in any ToDo will expand the full description of the ToDo.
